	My hypothesis was that wealthier neighborhoods have greater access to drugs that treat Dementia; therefore, doctors prescribe drugs for Dementia more in wealthier counties. The most common drugs used to treat Dementia are Donepezil, Rivastigmine, Galantamine, Memantine, and a combination drug of Donepezil and Memantine. I first searched through the Medicare data, medDrugs2017.gz, that showed doctors’ NPI numbers and the total day's supply prescribed for these four drugs, and I recorded which NPI numbers prescribed these drugs and the total day supply that they prescribed. I then used the NPI convertor, npi.gz, to find each of the doctors’ zip codes. After doing this, I made a conversion table of zip codes to counties, only looking at zip codes with Dementia drugs prescribed, to use now and later in my project. Using the table, I converted the zip codes to counties, resulting in the total day's supply of Dementia drugs per county. I then found the population 65 and over per zip code and used that along with the zip codes to county conversion table to find the population 65 and older of the counties for which Dementia drugs were prescribed. Afterwards, I found the ratio of drugs prescribed per county population. Using the Medicare data of the prevalence of various illnesses, County_Prevalence_2017.txt, I found the prevalence of Dementia per county and divided the ratio of Dementia drugs per population per county by the prevalence of Dementia per county, resulting in the ratio of drugs per Dementia patient per county. This result ended up being my y-axis. I then looked at the income per zip code from the IncomePop.gz file. I converted those zip codes to counties using the previously made zip to county conversion table, which by nature only converted those zip codes associated with Dementia drug prescriptions. This resulted in the average zip code per county, which is the x-axis. The next step was to add these x and y axes to a file and use that file to plot the results. 
	At first, after plotting the results, there did not appear to be a strong correlation between the total day supply of Dementia drugs per county and the income of the county. In fact, it appeared that those with higher incomes were not prescribed Dementia drugs as often as those with lower incomes. However, upon looking at the minimum drug days per county, those with higher incomes have a higher minimum total day's supply of drugs. This suggests that those with high incomes use means other than Medicare to get their treatment; however, those who do go through Medicare for Dementia drugs are less likely to be given a low supply of the prescription compared to counties with lower incomes.
